# A migration bundle boots the service's own host to obtain its configured
# DbContext, and every service's Program.cs throws at startup if Jwt:Key is
# missing. Without a value EF falls back to a bare DbContext and fails with

# or validates a token, so a placeholder is enough - and deliberately not the
# real key, which the migration job has no business holding.
